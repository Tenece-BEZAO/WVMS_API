## Contributors Guide
1. Visit the project repository on [Github](https://github.com/Tenece-BEZAO/WVMS_API.git)<br/>
2. Make a local clone: <br/>
  Create a folder on your local machine for the project <br/>
  Open Command prompt / Terminal in the same folder location <br/>
  In your Terminal, type: <br/>
  `git clone https://github.com/Tenece-BEZAO/WVMS_API.git` 
3. Pull upstream to get up to date with the original repo:<br/>
    `git pull -u development`
4. Create a new branch for the task you are working on :<br/>
    `git checkout -b branchName`<br/>
    *(Ensure your branchName is descriptive in context to the feature you are working on. Also be sure to check which branch you are on using `git status` before you begin working)*
5. When you're done with your task, run:<br/>
    `git add`<br/>
6. Commit changes with descriptive message:<br/>
   `git commit -m "message"`
7. To avoid conflicts:<br/>
    `git pull -u development`
    *(before branching out to a new branch)
8. Then push your branch:<br/>
    `git push origin branchName` - This creates the branch remotely and pushes to that branch on the Github

9. Go to Github and create a new pull request to the development branch, for review and subsequent merge.
